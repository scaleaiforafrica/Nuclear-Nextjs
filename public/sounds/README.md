# Notification Sounds

This directory contains notification sound files used by the notification system.

## Required Sound Files

The following sound files should be placed in this directory:

1. **info.mp3** - Sound for informational notifications
2. **success.mp3** - Sound for success notifications
3. **warning.mp3** - Sound for warning notifications
4. **error.mp3** - Sound for error notifications
5. **shipment.mp3** - Sound for shipment-related notifications
6. **compliance.mp3** - Sound for compliance-related notifications

## Sound File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Duration: 0.5 - 2 seconds (short, non-intrusive)
- Volume: Moderate (will be played at 50% volume)
- Quality: Good enough for web playback

## Temporary Placeholder

Until actual sound files are added, the notification system will attempt to play these sounds but fail silently if they don't exist. The notification functionality will still work without sounds.

## Generating Sounds

You can use free sound generation tools or libraries like:
- Web-based: https://sfxr.me/ (for simple notification sounds)
- Free sound libraries: https://freesound.org/
- Text-to-speech services for custom notification tones

Make sure you have the rights to use any sounds you add to this project.
